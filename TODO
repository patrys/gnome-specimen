List of things that should/could be done
========================================

- Remember the current list of previews between restarts:
  - Add an entry (list type) to the GConf schema
  - Handle the GConf value in code (store, restore)

- Allow drag and drop from the left pane to the preview pane

- Make hyperlinks in the about dialog work

- Add tooltips for the buttons

- Search interface for the font listing (needs thinking)
